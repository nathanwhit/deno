  Loaders, actions and workflows for adding Wake Commerce Platform to your deco.cx website.

<p align="center">
Wake, a Locaweb Company brand, was born thinking about the entire customer journey, in a much more fluid way and with consistent integrations. Our brand is divided into three business pillars: Wake Commerce (Headless Platform, Marketplace Hub and OMS), Wake Experience (Cloud marketing tool focused on consumer behavior) and Squid by Wake (Digital influencer platform).
  
Wake is the game changer in technology for those who think big and want to go further, with a tireless focus on high performance in every detail.

This app wrapps Wake Commerce API into a comprehensive set of loaders/actions/workflows
empowering non technical users to interact and act upon their headless commerce.
